# Chester The Chat

**Chester The Chat** is a lightweight IP/UDP-based local network chat application built with the Qt Framework (C++). It's designed to support multiple instances on the same machine, each with isolated configuration, making it ideal for local testing or LAN-based messaging scenarios.

## Build Instructions

### Requirements

- Qt 5.15+ or Qt 6.x
- C++17 (or higher)
- Qt Creator or any CMake/qmake-based setup
- MinGW 64 (or equivalent compiler)

### Build using Qt Creator

1. Open `ChesterTheChat.pro` in Qt Creator.
2. Configure your desired kit (MinGW or MSVC).
3. Build and run.

### Run multiple instances

Each instance creates its own `.ini` file (`instance_1_settings.ini`, `instance_2_settings.ini`, etc.) in the executable directory. This allows running multiple sessions concurrently from the same folder.
